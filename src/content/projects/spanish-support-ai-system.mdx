## The Problem: Growing Spanish Customers, Zero Support

Planning Center serves 50,000+ churches worldwide with a rapidly growing Spanish-speaking customer base. But we had **zero Spanish support capacity**:

- **2-3 day response delays** for Spanish inquiries (escalation bottlenecks)
- **$60K+/year cost** to hire bilingual agents with months of training
- **Frustrated customers** leaving due to language barriers
- **Team stress** from inability to help significant customer segment

## My Solution: Custom AI System in 4 Weeks

Instead of waiting for budget approval and lengthy hiring, I built a scalable AI system that transformed our English-speaking team into effective Spanish support providers.

### Core Innovation: Smart Terminology Guardrails

**The problem with generic translation:** Tools like Google Translate fail with specialized church/tech terminology, creating confusing responses.

**My breakthrough:** Custom GPT with intelligent guardrails that preserve Planning Center's exact terminology while providing natural Spanish explanations.

**Example:**
- **Generic AI**: "Click Calendario to access events" ❌
- **My System**: "Click Calendar (Calendario) to access your events" ✅

### Implementation & Training

**Workflow Design:**
1. Agent receives Spanish inquiry in Front
2. Uses custom GPT to generate contextually appropriate response
3. Reviews using terminology checklist
4. Responds confidently in Front

**Team Training:**
- Step-by-step Notion documentation with visual guides
- Live practice sessions with real customer scenarios  
- Ongoing support channel for questions and improvements
- Complete training materials and process documentation created

## Results: Immediate Transformation

### Business Impact
- **100% team adoption** - All agents now handle Spanish inquiries confidently
- **No Spanish Support → same day** response time improvement

### Team Impact  
- **Eliminated language stress** - Agents feel empowered to help all customers
- **Improved confidence** in handling diverse customer needs
- **Seamless integration** with existing Front workflow
- **Enhanced job satisfaction** from expanded capability

### Customer Impact
- **Professional Spanish responses** maintaining Planning Center's helpful tone
- **Technical accuracy preserved** through terminology guardrails
- **Cultural sensitivity** appropriate for church communities
- **Same quality experience** as English-language support

## Technical Innovation

**Custom GPT Architecture:**
- **150+ specialized terms** mapped for church/tech context
- **Cultural adaptation** for religious terminology and regional dialects
- **Quality safeguards** with confidence scoring and escalation triggers
- **Workflow integration** designed for Front support process

**Smart Guardrails System:**
- Preserves Planning Center product names in English with Spanish explanations
- Context-aware translations based on UI elements and features
- Professional tone guidelines avoiding overly formal language
- Pattern recognition for technical instructions and navigation

## Key Achievement

**Solved "impossible" problem:** Achieved full Spanish support capacity without bilingual hiring, saving significant costs while improving customer experience and team capability.

**Why this matters:** Demonstrated ability to identify unconventional solutions to complex operational challenges, build custom AI tools for specialized business needs, and achieve enterprise-level results with startup efficiency.
