## The Problem: Documentation Bottleneck in Support

**Context:** This was built in early 2024, during my initial exploration of AI for support operations, before having access to purpose-built documentation tools.

Creating training documentation from recorded sessions was incredibly time-consuming:
- **Manual transcription** of spoken instructions
- **Screenshot capture** and annotation 
- **Step-by-step recreation** of demonstrated actions
- **Formatting** and organization in documentation systems

**The bottleneck:** Documentation took **3-4x longer** than the original training session, preventing knowledge sharing and reducing training consistency.

## The Solution: DIY AI Documentation Pipeline

Since we didn't have access to proper AI-powered documentation tools, I built a creative workaround using available tools:

### How It Worked

**1. Dual Recording Setup**
- **ClearShot**: Screen recording with automatic transcript generation
- **Chrome DevTools Recorder**: Captured exact browser interactions as JSON

**2. AI Processing** 
- Fed both transcript and browser JSON into a custom GPT
- GPT combined "what was said" with "what was actually done"
- Generated structured Notion documentation ready to paste

**3. Key Innovation: Dual-Source Accuracy**
- **Transcript** = Intent and context ("why" behind actions)
- **Browser JSON** = Technical precision (exact steps and elements)

### The Results

**Before:** 45 minutes to manually document a 10-minute bug discovery  
**After:** 5 minutes to generate comprehensive reproduction steps

- **80% time reduction** in documentation creation
- **95%+ accuracy** with minimal manual editing required
- **100% team adoption** for complex procedures

## Why This Early Experiment Mattered

This project represents the kind of **creative problem-solving with early AI tools** that characterized support operations before purpose-built solutions became available:

- **Identified a real bottleneck** that was preventing knowledge sharing
- **Combined existing tools creatively** to achieve AI-powered automation
- **Built something the team actually used** and delivered measurable results
- **Demonstrated ROI of AI adoption** before enterprise tools were accessible

**The lesson:** Sometimes the best solutions come from experimenting with available tools rather than waiting for the perfect solution to be built for you.

This workflow later influenced how we approached AI integration across other support processes and validated the value of investing in proper documentation tooling.
