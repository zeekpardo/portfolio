## The Problem

Churches needed custom reports but Planning Center's Liquid templating required technical expertise they didn't have.

## The Solution

Built an AI system that converts natural language requests into working Liquid code. Users describe what they want in plain English, AI generates the technical implementation.

## Real Example

**Request:** "Show events with rooms, room resources, and event tags"

**AI Output:** Complete Liquid template with:
- ✅ Rooms with nested resources
- ✅ Dedicated resources column  
- ✅ Event tags column
- ✅ Proper syntax and data relationships

## Technical Approach

**Context Training:** Fed AI all Planning Center templates, variables, and data patterns
**Processing:** Parses requests → maps to template patterns → generates valid code
**Validation:** Ensures syntax correctness and data integrity

## Impact

**Support Team:** Eliminated hours of custom coding per request
**Customers:** Self-service report customization capability  
**Metrics:** Hours to minutes generation time, 100% code accuracy

**Key Achievement:** Transformed technical barrier into user empowerment through intelligent automation.
